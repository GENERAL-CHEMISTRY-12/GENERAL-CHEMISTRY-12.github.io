    <h2>Introduction to Chemistry</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Chemistry is a fundamental branch of science that focuses on the study of matter—its composition, structure, properties, and the changes it undergoes during physical and chemical processes.</strong> Matter includes everything that has mass and occupies space, from the air we breathe to the cells in our bodies and the materials that make up our everyday surroundings.
    <br><br>At its core, chemistry seeks to understand what substances are made of—how atoms and molecules come together, interact, and rearrange to form new substances. This includes studying how elements bond to form compounds, how substances behave under different conditions, and how energy is involved in chemical reactions.
    <br><br><strong>Chemistry serves as a bridge between the physical sciences and the life sciences.</strong> In the physical sciences, it overlaps with physics to explain the fundamental forces and energy changes that drive chemical behavior. In the life sciences, chemistry is essential for understanding biological processes at the molecular level, such as how enzymes function, how cells communicate, and how genetic information is expressed and transferred.
    <br><br>By exploring the behavior of matter at the atomic and molecular scale, chemistry gives us a deeper understanding of the natural world. It allows us to explain everyday phenomena—why food spoils, how batteries work, why medications affect the body, and how environmental pollutants interact with ecosystems.
    <br><br>Moreover, chemistry is central to innovation and progress in fields like medicine, materials science, environmental science, agriculture, and energy. It equips us with the knowledge to design new materials, develop sustainable technologies, combat diseases, and address global challenges.
    <br><br>In essence, <strong>chemistry helps us make sense of how the universe operates at its most fundamental level—revealing the hidden mechanisms behind the visible world and enabling us to shape it in meaningful ways.</strong>
