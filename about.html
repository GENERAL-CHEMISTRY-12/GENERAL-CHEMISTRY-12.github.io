    <h2>Why Study Chemistry?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Chemistry is a central branch of science focused on the study of matter—its composition, structure, properties, and the changes it undergoes during physical and chemical processes.</strong> At its core, chemistry seeks to understand what substances are made of (from atoms and molecules to complex compounds), how they interact with each other, and what governs these interactions at the molecular and atomic levels.
    <br><br>Chemistry plays a foundational role in both the <strong>physical sciences</strong>—like physics and earth science—and the <strong>life sciences</strong>, such as biology and medicine. It acts as a bridge between them, providing the molecular-level explanations for biological processes (biochemistry), the behavior of materials (materials science), and environmental phenomena (environmental chemistry). For instance, understanding how enzymes catalyze reactions in the human body, how batteries store energy, or how pollutants interact with air and water all require chemical knowledge.
    <br><br>Through its various subfields—including <strong>organic, inorganic, physical, analytical</strong>, and <strong>biochemistry</strong>—chemistry allows us to develop new materials, create medicines, improve agricultural practices, understand climate change, and even explore the chemistry of other planets.
    <br><br>Ultimately, chemistry helps us decode the invisible processes that govern everything from the food we eat and the air we breathe to the technology we use. It enables us to manipulate matter at the smallest scales to solve problems and improve life, making it an essential science for understanding and shaping the modern world.
