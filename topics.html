        <h3>1. Matter and Its Properties</h3>
        <p>Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. It constitutes all physical substances in the universe, existing primarily in three classical states: solid, liquid, and gas. However, under extreme conditions, matter can also exist in other forms such as plasma, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fermionic condensates.</p>

        <h3>2. Atomic Structure</h3>
        <p>Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter and the smallest units of chemical elements that retain the element’s properties. Each atom is composed of three primary subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons reside in the atom’s central nucleus, with protons carrying a positive electrical charge and neutrons having no charge. Surrounding this nucleus is a cloud of electrons, negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in defined energy levels or shells. The specific number and arrangement of these subatomic particles determine the atom’s chemical identity and behavior, such as how it bonds with other atoms, its reactivity, and its place on the periodic table. Together, atoms combine to form molecules and all the substances we encounter in the physical world.</p>

        <h3>3. The Periodic Table</h3>
        <p>The periodic table is a systematic arrangement of all known chemical elements, organized primarily by increasing atomic number—the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. This structure not only provides a convenient reference for identifying elements but also reveals consistent and meaningful patterns in their physical and chemical properties. Elements are grouped into rows called periods and columns called groups or families, where those in the same group often share similar chemical behaviors due to having the same number of valence electrons. For example, the elements in Group 1 (alkali metals) are highly reactive and have one valence electron, while those in Group 18 (noble gases) are largely inert due to their full outer electron shells. As you move across a period from left to right, properties such as electronegativity, ionization energy, and atomic radius change in predictable ways. The periodic table is a powerful tool in chemistry and other sciences, enabling scientists to predict how elements will react, form compounds, and behave under various conditions. It reflects the underlying principles of atomic structure and quantum mechanics.</p>

        <h3>4. Chemical Bonding</h3>
        <p>Atoms combine with one another through different types of chemical bonds—namely ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds—to form compounds and molecules that make up all matter. These bonds are the result of interactions between the electrons of atoms, particularly those in the outermost energy level, known as valence electrons.
        <br><br>In an ionic bond, atoms transfer electrons from one to another. This typically occurs between metals and nonmetals. The metal loses one or more electrons to become a positively charged ion (cation), while the nonmetal gains electrons to become a negatively charged ion (anion). The opposite charges attract, holding the ions together in a crystal lattice structure—as seen in table salt (sodium chloride).
        <br><br>A covalent bond involves the sharing of electron pairs between nonmetal atoms. This type of bond creates molecules where atoms are held together by shared electrons, such as in water (H₂O) or carbon dioxide (CO₂). Covalent bonds can be single, double, or triple, depending on the number of shared electron pairs.
        <br><br>Metallic bonds, on the other hand, occur between metal atoms. In this type of bonding, valence electrons are not held by any specific atom and instead form a "sea of electrons" that flows freely around positively charged metal ions. This electron mobility gives metals their characteristic properties, such as electrical conductivity, malleability, and luster.
        <br><br>Through these bonding processes, atoms are able to achieve more stable electron configurations, often resembling the electron arrangements of noble gases. The resulting compounds and molecules display a wide range of physical and chemical properties, depending on the types of atoms and bonds involved.</p>

        <h3>5. Chemical Reactions</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions involve the transformation of substances by breaking existing chemical bonds and forming new ones, resulting in the creation of entirely new substances with different properties. During a chemical reaction, the atoms themselves are not created or destroyed; rather, they are rearranged into new combinations. This process follows the law of conservation of mass, which states that the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products.
        <br><br>Reactants—the starting materials—undergo changes at the molecular level, where bonds between atoms are broken, requiring energy input. New bonds then form between atoms, often releasing energy. The balance between these energy changes determines whether a reaction is exothermic (releases energy) or endothermic (absorbs energy).
        <br><br>Chemical reactions can occur in various forms, including synthesis (combination) reactions, decomposition, single and double replacement, and combustion. Each type involves a different pattern of how atoms are rearranged. Indicators of a chemical reaction include changes in temperature, color, the formation of a gas or solid (precipitate), and the production of light or heat.
        <br><br>Ultimately, chemical reactions are fundamental to countless natural processes and technologies—from digestion and respiration in living organisms to industrial manufacturing and energy production.</p>
